This is the source code of my project for the course ENGG1110 Program Solving by Programming. 

In this project, we are required to implement the game tik-tac-toe in C language.

If you are taking this course and are having trouble finishing your project, you may take a look at my source code to get some sort of hints.

If you are a beginner at programming and having any trouble in this course, you may reach out to me as well.
